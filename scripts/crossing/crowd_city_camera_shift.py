"""Vendored from utils/segmentation/camera_shift.py of https://github.com/crowd-dataset/crowd-city (main, commit 340875e), unchanged.

How far the background slides sideways while a pedestrian is tracked.

When the car turns, the whole picture sweeps sideways, and a pedestrian
standing on the pavement is carried across the image as if crossing. The
box-only camera-motion check (independent_motion_rejection) catches this
only when a static object is tracked in the same frames; this measures the
sweep from the picture itself.

Consecutive frames, CAMERA_SHIFT_HZ apart and scaled to FRAME_WIDTH, are
compared by phase correlation over their upper half (buildings and the far
scene rather than the road and nearby traffic), and the sideways shifts are
summed into the background's displacement over the window, in image widths
(positive to the right).
