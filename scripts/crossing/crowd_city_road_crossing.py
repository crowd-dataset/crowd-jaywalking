"""Road-surface crossing rules, vendored from utils/crossing/road_crossing.py of https://github.com/crowd-dataset/crowd-city (main, commit 340875e).

Changed only here: the imports, ``road_intervals_for_tracks`` (from road_metrics.py)
is defined below, and the Waymo calibration plumbing at the end of the file is left out.

Road-surface crossing rules, and the segmentation plumbing they need on Waymo.

The CROWD detector decides a crossing from bounding-box geometry alone: the
track must pass through a narrow vertical strip in the middle of the image and
survive a series of motion filters. Tested against Waymo ground truth, that
finds about one real crosser in six, and its mistakes are mostly pedestrians
on the footpath. Knowing which surface the feet are on fixes both:

* ``detector_on_road`` (rule B): a detector pick whose feet are on the road at
  some point. It removes footpath mistakes without losing any real crossing.
  It is reported, but the speed model still trains on every detector pick:
  training on rule B narrowed the predicted spread on untouched validation
  below its limit.
* ``road_crossing`` (rule D): the feet are on the road, the track moves across
  at least ``min_crossing_x_range`` of the image while there, and its box size
  changes slowly (people walking along the road towards or away from the
  camera grow or shrink quickly). It is not tied to the middle strip, so it
  finds about twice as many real crossings; it is the rule used to count them.

Both were chosen on the Waymo training split and checked on the untouched
validation split (see utils/crossing/waymo_segmentation_evaluation.py).
