"""Vendored from utils/segmentation/surface.py of https://github.com/crowd-dataset/crowd-city (main, commit 340875e), with only the import path changed.

Turn SegFormer label maps into per-track surface timelines and intervals.

Two things are derived here. First, the surface under a pedestrian's feet in
each sampled frame, read from a small band around the bottom edge of the
bounding box rather than a single pixel, because a single footpoint lands on
the pedestrian's own shoes as often as on the ground. Second, the interval in
which the pedestrian is actually on the carriageway, which is what the crossing
speed and the hesitation time are measured against.
