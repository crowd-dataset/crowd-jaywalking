"""Vendored from utils/segmentation/constants.py of https://github.com/crowd-dataset/crowd-city (main, commit 340875e), unchanged.

Cityscapes label constants and the surface categories CROWD derives from them.

SegFormer checkpoints finetuned on Cityscapes emit the 19 evaluation classes in
``trainId`` order. Only a handful of them describe the ground a pedestrian can
stand on; the rest are either scenery or dynamic objects that may occlude the
footpoint of a pedestrian bounding box.
