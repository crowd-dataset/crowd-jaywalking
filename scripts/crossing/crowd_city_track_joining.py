"""Track joining, vendored from crowd-city.

Copied unchanged from ``utils/crossing/track_joining.py`` of
https://github.com/crowd-dataset/crowd-city (main, commit 340875e).

Repair broken pedestrian tracks before any crossing logic sees them.

YOLO's tracker often splits one pedestrian into several track ids: a crossing
pedestrian hidden for a moment behind the vehicle in front of the camera comes
back under a new id, and an id can be reused much later for someone else. A
crossing rule that judges each id on its own then sees half a crossing at a
time. On a hand-reviewed busy CROWD segment, 20 of the 29 crossers YOLO
detected but the rule missed were split this way.

join_track_pieces relabels the detections so that each id is one pedestrian:
every continuous stretch of an id (no gap over RUN_GAP_SECONDS) becomes its
own piece, and a piece that starts within MAXIMUM_JOIN_GAP_SECONDS after
another ends, where that one's sideways velocity puts the pedestrian and with
a similar box size, continues it under the same id. Every later step
(detector, road-crossing rule, segmentation, speed) then works on the joined
tracks.
